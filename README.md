# Hospital DB ASP MVC
 
For the first phase of our Hospital Management System in ASP.NET MVC with C#. 
We had to create an application with four pages: Home, Doctors, Patients and Visits. 
Our pages were to link to each other. They were to have CRUD implementation (Create, Read, Update, Delete). 

Second Phase:
We were to add functionality to our first phase. Functionality such as: Searching for a doctor, patient, or a visit (by at least two criteria). 
Also recording when a patient is admitted and discharged, adding a leave date in the visit table. 
This phase required radio buttons and modifying the index views for search functionality.

Third Phase:
We were to further add functionality to our second phase. 
Functionality such as: a login page, a layout, field validation, commented code, and our choice of other options. 
Our login page was setup so on Startup of the application, it would require you to login to move forward. 
Once logged in, on the home page it would display your username. 
Our layout is a navbar at the top of the page with a hospital image. 
Our field validation was done in the models and functioned throughout the application. 
Code was commented where it made sense for comments.
